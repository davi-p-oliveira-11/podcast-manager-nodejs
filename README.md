## Code Overview

### Server Setup

The application uses Node.js to create an HTTP server that listens for specific endpoints and responds with podcast data.

#### Example Code:

```typescript
import * as http from "http";
import {
  getFilterEpisodes,
  getListEpisodes,
} from "./controllers/podcasts-controller";
import { Routes } from "./routes/routes";
import { HttpMethod } from "./utils/http-methods";

export const app = async (
  request: http.IncomingMessage,
  res: http.ServerResponse
) => {
  const baseUrl = request.url?.split("?")[0];

  // List podcasts
  if (request.method === HttpMethod.GET && baseUrl === Routes.LIST) {
    await getListEpisodes(request, res);
  }

  // Filter episodes by podcast name
  if (request.method === HttpMethod.GET && baseUrl === Routes.EPISODE) {
    await getFilterEpisodes(request, res);
  }
};
```

### Used Technologies

The project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend of the application.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions.
- **[tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx)**: A fast TypeScript runtime and loader, used for running and watching TypeScript files during development.
- **[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)**: A simple bundler for TypeScript projects, used to build the production-ready code.
- **[@types/node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node)**: Type definitions for Node.js, ensuring better type safety in TypeScript projects.

These technologies ensure efficient development, type safety, and optimized builds for the project.
